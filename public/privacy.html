      <p>Welcome to ProFlow. This Privacy Policy explains how our application uses and protects your information. By using ProFlow, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

      <h2>Information Access via Gmail API</h2>
      <p>ProFlow integrates with the Gmail API to help you manage email workflows. With your explicit consent, the app will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read your emails in a read-only manner to analyze content and context (e.g., sender, subject, body, labels).</li>
        <li>Optionally send automated or templated replies on your behalf when you enable this feature. You can disable this at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>ProFlow does not delete emails or modify your mailbox structure unless you explicitly trigger actions that require such permissions.</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>Data accessed from Gmail is used solely to provide core features such as email analysis, prioritization, and optional auto-replies. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.</p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS), least-privilege access, and restricted credentials. Despite our efforts, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>User Control and Revoking Access</h2>
      <p>You are in control of your data and permissions. You can revoke ProFlow's access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google Account permissions page. Once access is revoked, ProFlow will no longer be able to read emails or send replies on your behalf.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>ProFlow retains only the minimal data necessary to operate the service and caches information transiently where required for performance. You can request deletion of any stored data by contacting us.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties. Service providers that help operate the application (e.g., hosting) may have limited access under strict confidentiality and data protection obligations.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>ProFlow is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions or requests about this Privacy Policy or the use of your data, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@example.com">privacy@example.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date above to reflect changes. Material changes may be communicated via the app or email.</p>
